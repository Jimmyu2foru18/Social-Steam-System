## 10. Post-Launch and Continuous Improvement

### 10.1 User Feedback Loop

(ex. we are glad to gear from you we will contact you within 48 hours...")

Key Enhancements:
1. Added detailed risk assessment and mitigation planning
2. Expanded technology stack selection and architecture design phase
3. Included more comprehensive security and compliance considerations

To build and host this project we will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and AWS:

## 1. Local Development

### 1.1 Frontend Development
- Create responsive HTML structure
- Style with CSS.
- Implement interactive features using JavaScript

### 1.2 Backend Development
- Set up PHP development environment
- Develop PHP scripts for server-side logic
- Create MySQL database schema and queries

### 1.3 Integration
- Connect frontend with PHP backend
- Implement AJAX calls for dynamic content loading

## 2. AWS Environment Setup

### 2.1 EC2 Instance
- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance
- Configure security groups for web traffic in java

### 2.2 Instance for MySQL
- Create an Amazon instance for MySQL
- Configure database connections and security

### 2.3 Elastic IP
- Allocate and associate an Elastic IP to your EC2 instance ("we can do this Post product competion")

## 3. Deployment

### 3.1 Web Server Setup
- Install and configure Apache web server on EC2 MySql java, php, phpmyadmin
- Set up PHP on the EC2 instance

### 3.2 Code Deployment
- Use Methods to transfer your code to EC2 (filezilla)

### 3.3 Database Migration
- Migrate your local MySQL data to Amazon instance of MYSQL

## 4. Performance Optimization

### 4.1 Caching							("Remote Dictionary Server")
- Implement server-side caching with Redis
- Set up browser caching for static assets

## 5. Security Implementation ("any code will be written in java")

### 5.1 SSL/TLS

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 6.1 Logging
- Set up log management and monitoring

### 6.2 Backups
- Configure automated backups for EC2 

### 6.3 Updates
- Allow for easy regularly update EC2 instance, PHP


## "Notes" Things We Want
We want to have this project on github using the system developed above 
we want the system to be edited on guthub and updated on our system as we make changes to the files on github the files change on the instance.
